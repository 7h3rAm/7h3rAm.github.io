          <p>I basically divided the project into three independent tasks:</p>

<ol>
<li>source shellcode from shell-storm, exploit-db and metasploit</li>
<li>generate pcaps for obtained shellcode</li>
<li>test shellcode with Libemu and pcaps with Snort/Suricata/Bro</li>
</ol>

<p>These are independent since any of them can be used individually, as a
unit, and developed outside of the system. The first task itself was
divided into smaller sub-tasks and I started with sourcing shellcode
from shell-storm. The shell-storm shellcode page documents steps needed
to access shell-storm database and there is an example script that
provides an easy to use cli to search for and download individual
shellcode files from shell-storm. I used this script in my project and
added a wrapper over it to search, download and generate pcaps all with
just one cli invocation. The script currently is in beta and satisfies
only a few of the above requirements. Shell-storm sourcing is
implemented, pcap generation is working and shellcode testing currently
happens with Libemu only. Additional sources and analysis engines would
be added shortly.</p>

<p>Please visit the following link to get the complete source listing:
<a href="https://gist.github.com/7h3rAm/11087025">sap</a></p>

<p>It will read configuration file to populate internal variables and then
move on to its core. First, the <code>doshellstorm()</code> method is called to
source shellcode samples from shell-storm. The API example script is
used to search shellcode that satisfies certain search criteria and then
matching shell-storm shellcode ids are downloaded, extracted and saved
to a <code>&lt;shellcode-id&gt;.bin</code> named file. For all shellcode ids for which we
successfully extracted shellcode bytes, they are then passed onto the
<code>bin2pcap()</code> method which uses an updated version of
<a href="https://github.com/7h3rAm/PCAP-Generation-Tools">PCAPGGenerationTTools</a>
and creates pcap files with HTTP GET/POST requests and <a href="https://github.com/7h3rAm/PCAP-Generation-Tools/commit/fc7418eefc9febef936d4646c61bad67e26935b7">TCP
CTS/STC</a>
sessions. These pcaps can then be tested with intrusion detection
engines in the pipeline. Once the pcap generation module completes, the
Libemu engine is invoked and run over all <code>.bin</code> shellcode files. Later
versions will add support for Snort/Suricata/Bro based shellcode pcap
testing.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s have a look at the help message from the tool:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>There are no mandatory options since most of them are read from the
config file if not available on the command-line. The tool supports
explicit lookup for shell-storm, exploitdb or metasploit projects. Pcap
generation has to be explicitly requested but it will be inherently
skipped if no bin files are not created for obtained shellcode. Let&#8217;s
have a test run of the tool with <code>arm</code> as the search string to test only
ARM shellcode available at Shell-Storm:</p>

</code></pre>

<p>I enabled <code>debug</code> output for additional verbosity in the above
command-line. The tool identified 26 shellcode samples that satisfy
search criteria <code>arm</code>. From these 26 samples, only 10 could be converted
to <code>.bin</code> equivalents via the regex pattern and these were then passed
on to the Libemu analysis engine. Those familiar with Libemu will
immediately notice that all of these 10 tested shellcode samples,
<code>offset</code> was found to be -1 which indicates that Libemu failed in
identification of these as probable shellcode candidates. The offset
value returned by the <code>shellcode_getpc_test()</code> method should ideally be
0 or more to indicate the starting offset inside the input buffer from
where the actual shellcode starts. Since Libemu only supports x86
architecture, all the 10 ARM shellcode samples were bound to fail in the
above test.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s now try a Windows x86 shellcode with the tool:</p>

<p>Id 162 was successfully identified by Libemu as shellcode and it even
generated the profiling output for it. From the profile output it seems
like the shellcode, when executed, will trigger the download and
execution of a malware sample. This is also evident from the shellcode
description provided by shell-storm for this shellcode id:</p>

<p>Currently Libemu is the only analysis engine but soon I&#8217;ll be adding
support for additional engines. Sourcing from other projects will also
be added in subsequent versions. Feel free to try it out and let me know
what you think of it.</p>
