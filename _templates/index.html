            <p>I'm Ankur Tyagi, an infoSec enthusiast and security researcher. I use <strong>7h3rAm</strong> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet" target="_blank">IPA</a>: <i>θˈɛɹam</i>) as my handle and you can find me using it on most social platforms. At present, malware analysis, file-format decoding, and network traffic inspection are my primary areas of interest.</p>
            <p>I've completed my graduate studies with a formal background in Computer Science and Software Systems. I started my professional journey with Vulnerability Assessment as the primary work domain but in a few years moved to Intrusion Prevention which eventually became my expertise. In an attempt to further improve infosec domain understanding, I moved to my present profile where I work as a Malware Researcher and get exposure to a wide array of concepts and ideas.</p>
            <p>I have always been involved in <a href="/research.html">research</a> activities and continue to present my work at premiere <a href="/research.html#talks">security conferences</a> throughout the world. This blog documents research ideas and lists updates on several topics of interest that span <a href="/tags.html">security</a>, <a href="/tags.html#code">programming</a> and <a href="/tags.html#writeups">problem solving</a> in general. It is completely <a href="https://github.com/7h3rAm/7h3rAm.github.io" target="_blank">opensource</a> and created using a minimal static site generator, that I developed, called <a href="https://github.com/7h3rAm/kalpi/" target="_blank">Kalpi</a>.</p>
            <p>Though <a href="http://www.marco.org/2010/06/16/comments" target="_blank">comments have been disabled explicitly</a>, I certainly welcome feedback. If there's anything I can help with please let me know. I'm happy to help in any way I can so don't hesitate to get in touch.
