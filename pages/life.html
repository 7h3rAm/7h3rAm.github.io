                            <li><strong>Cull your inputs.</strong> (Life is about consciously designing one's life and work habits to minimize distractions.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Big picture first. Details later.</strong> (Worrying about missing details and intermediate steps is a sure way to shut our intuitions up, and to miss out on some of our best shots at creative breakthroughs.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't just find a mentor. Allow yourself to be mentored.</strong> (It requires humility to take guidance to heart, even when it's uncomfortable, challenging, or counterintuitive.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Value generalizing over specializing. A brilliant and creative mind must not insist upon living in a modern monastic cell.</strong> (Keep your interests broad rather than deep. Cultivate you natural curiosity. Pursue multiple ideas, let them evolve with time. Sometimes, strangely distinct ideas converge and when they don't, let them go. Always keep your mind agile with an array of hobbies.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Chaos is okay.</strong> (Chaos is the condition of the remarkable work. Use the limited mental energy into investigating creative pursuits than tidying up.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Time is the soil in which ideas grow.</strong> (Genius takes time. Follow your creative pursuits but remember the flashes of intuition. Creative work isn't linear; ideas come when they come. Have the willingness to let your old ideas mature.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Consider the content of your friendships.</strong> (There's a fine line between arrogance and serene self-confidence. Root your confidence in your intellectual resources and stay on the right side of the line.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Put money in it's place.</strong> (Wealth is not an opportunity to live lavishly, rather a way to spend more time on ideas that interest you. Be wealthy but don't be consumed by the pursuit of wealth. Remeber, wealth almost always comes as an indirect result of  incredible work rather than as the end goal.** (Apple, Google and Tesla are good examples)</li>
                    <li><strong>Fancy is easy. Simple is hard.</strong> (Achieving simplicity may actually be the more intellectually demanding endeavor. It takes work to distill, to get at the essence of things, to be brief.)</li>
                    <li><strong>The less marketing you need, the better your idea or product probably is.</strong> (If an idea is striking and original, 'Stop trying to make <em>fetch</em> happen! It just isn't going to happen!' Stop flogging ideas well past the point which you should know better.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Value freedom over status.</strong> (Nothing weighs you down like too many pieces of flair. Freedom to explore your creative endeavors is more important than working to silence your critics.)</li>
                    <li><strong>Don't look for inspiration. Look for irritation.</strong> (A genius is simply someone who is usefully irritated. And useful irritation doesn't come until, somewhere in the midst of the work, you stumble onto something that troubles you.)</li>
