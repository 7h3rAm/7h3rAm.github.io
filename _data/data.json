It is completely <a href=\"https://github.com/7h3rAm/7h3rAm.github.io\" target=\"_blank\">opensource</a> and created using a minimal static site generator called <a href=\"https://github.com/7h3rAm/kalpi/\" target=\"_blank\">Kalpi</a>.</p><p>I've completed my graduate studies with a formal background in Computer Science and Software Systems. I started my professional journey with Vulnerability Assessment as the primary work domain but in a few years moved to Intrusion Prevention which eventually became my expertise. In an attempt to further improve infosec domain understanding, I moved to my present profile where I work as a Malware Researcher and get exposure to a wide array of concepts and ideas. At present, malware analysis, file-format decoding and network traffic inspection are my primary areas of interest.</p><p>I use <strong>7h3rAm</strong> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet\" target=\"_blank\">IPA</a>: <i>\u03b8\u02c8\u025b\u0279am</i>) as my handle and you can find me using it on most social platforms.

The input dataset is analyzed to collect various attributes which are then arranged in a number of feature vectors. These vectors are then individually visualized, indexed and then queried for each new input file. Matching vectors are labelled as per their AV detection categories for now but this could be changed to a heuristics approach if needed. If dynamic behavior or network traffic details are available, vectors are also converted into activity graphs that depict evolution of activity with a predefined time scale. This results into an animation of malware/malware category's behavior traits and is also useful in identifying activity overlaps across the input dataset.",
